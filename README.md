# FPVR
First Person View flight with VR Headsets

The aim of this project is not only to support FPV but to also including virtual environments and gimbal lag compensation to help eliminate motion sickness. The first headset supported is the Oculus and the first aircraft to be supported is the DJI Inspire 1. However, the shell is written in Unity and the vehicle model is exensible by a plugin system, so virtually any vehichle and gimbal system can be supported in time.
